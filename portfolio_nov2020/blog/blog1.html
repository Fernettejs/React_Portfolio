        <link>I don't even like the word blog. So, this is the last time I'll use it. From now on I'll call these coding thoughts. I'm going to give myself 20 minutes each week to write one of these coding thoughts. 
            That will give me about 10 minutes to talk about what I've done in the past week, and 10 minutes to talk about what I will do in the next week.
            Don't expect these things to sound very polished, because that's not what it's for. It's really just about accountability. 
            If you're curious enough to see what I'm doing and possibly what I'm thinking about it, check in every once in a while.

            Up to this point, I have been actively learning how to code/web develop for about six months. I started on Codecademy.com. I was going through their “Web Development” course and I learned a lot from it. This took me through HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the Command Line, Git and Github, the basics of React and basic problem solving when running into errors. 
            <br><br>

            Somewhere in the middle of my Codecademy journey, I started looking at YouTube videos more and more for help on specific issues. If I wanted a different explanation for a JS loop, I would just watch someone on YouTube. About three or four months in to Codecademy, I began getting away from it for the most part. This is when I began making my own projects and websites for family members. Nobody asked for a website, I just made it for them.
            <br><br>

            I have been googling and youtubing problems as they arise since. I usually fall asleep to YouTube videos explaining some type of web developing style. I was pretty focused on getting JS down at first, so I got through HTML and CSS pretty quick. This is when I created my sweet <a href="https://fernettejs.github.io/resources/More%20Cowbell/index.html" target="_blank"><b>More Cowbell Button!</b></a>
            <br><br>

            Then I applied for a job that was the first to answer me back. The recruiter for the company emailed me stating that the spot “requires a mastery of HTML/CSS and responsive design, as well as a strong design sense.” I was thinking, no big deal. That was until I looked at my original portfolio and knew I was screwed. My portfolio looked horrible and nothing was made to be responsive. Now, I have gotten back to more of the CSS styling and responsiveness.
            <br><br>

            Some of the latest projects I worked on included better colors and layouts; responsive everything; sticky navbars; a side navbar that moves to the top on mobile screens and also looks like a skateboard; video backgrounds; a sweet skateboarding design in general (an epic skateboarder said this); icons and containers that change with hover; a scrolling banner style for blogs (even though I only have one so far); added filters to images to match the page’s colors; and a lot of time finding and fixing bugs (mainly rearranging divs and classes for CSS to work correctly).
            <br><br>

            This last week I have started looking more at jQuery, Bootstrap (which I don’t think I’ll use much of), SASS, and more with React. 
            <br><br>
            <br><br>

            <h4>This coming week</h4> <br>


            Starting this weekend, I’m going to see how much time I should put into the libraries and frameworks mentioned above. My point of view right now is that they are pretty simple to use, you just have to google what you need and add it to your code.
            <br><br>

            I want to work a bit more with SASS because I feel that it can clean up a lot of my CSS code. Using that and React, I want to create another page that is very different than what I have done so far. I’ve used React a little bit with some things I don’t have up and I liked it. 
            <br><br>

            Other than projects, I need to apply to more jobs. I have my application in a few places so far. I haven’t heard from many of them, but I have updated my portfolio since I have applied anywhere. I am liking how everything is working out and looking so I need places to see what I’m working on. 
            <br><br>

            See you next week.
