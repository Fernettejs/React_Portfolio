This is my portfolio. You can view it live at https://fernettejs.github.io/. 

This quickly tells how I got to where I am now, my services, my projects, and how to contact me. This was a made from scratch portfolio using skills learned along the way.

For this project, I made sure to make it the most visually appealing. I am always finding cool new ways to include CSS and JS into this. I am always contributing and changing my portfolio. There are probably always going to be a few concepts on here that don't mesh with the overall design. This is because I like trying new things I find here, and if I like it, I keep it.  

I hope you enjoy looking around!
