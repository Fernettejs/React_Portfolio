        <p>I don't even like the word blog. So, this is the last time I'll use it. From now on I'll call these coding thoughts. I'm going to give myself 20 minutes each week to write one of these coding thoughts. 
            That will give me about 10 minutes to talk about what I've done in the past week, and 10 minutes to talk about what I will do in the next week.
            Don't expect these things to sound very polished, because that's not what it's for. It's really just about accountability. 
            If you're curious enough to see what I'm doing and possibly what I'm thinking about it, check in every once in a while.
